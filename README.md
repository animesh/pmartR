This R package provides functionality for quality control processing, statistical analysis and visualization of mass spectrometry (MS) omics data, in particular proteomic (either at the peptide or the protein level; isobaric labeled or unlabled), lipidomic, and metabolomic data. This includes data transformation, specification of groups that are to be compared against each other, filtering of feature and/or samples, data normalization, data summarization (correlation, PCA), and statistical comparisons of groups of interest (ANOVA and/or independence of missing data tests). Example data to be used with this packages can be found in [pmartRdata](https://github.com/pmartR/pmartRdata).
